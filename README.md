# Description

This is a fullstack project that utilizes JSON as its data storage system. The project allows for four methods of data manipulation: GET, PULL, DELETE, and POST. With these methods, it is easy to retrieve information from the database or add new information.

The project features a virtual game shop, where users can browse and "purchase" games to add to their personal library. Users can also delete games from their library or edit their names if needed.
